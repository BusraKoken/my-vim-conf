  My vim notes which shuld be somewhat of noteworthy.

Search
------
* Use g* or g# if you don't want to search for the exact word.
   (rain in rainbow)
* Press / then Ctrl-r then Ctrl-w to copy the current word to the command line.

Move
-----
* CTRL-E: Scroll down one line
* CTRL-Y: Scroll up one line
* }: Move to start of next paragraph
* {: Move to start of last paragraph

* m: Typing "m" followed by a letter creates a mark reference by that letter.
* ': The single quote followed by a mark letter (previously defined with the "m" as above),
     will move the cursor to the beginning of the line containing that mark.
